vim-cubescript
==============

A Vim syntax file for **CubeScript**, a scripting language used by the [Cube
Engine][1] and its derivatives. Cubescript draws heavy inspiration from
[Lisp][2], and is thus quite similar.

This README will be expanded later.

If you have an questions or interest, contact ZeroKnight. You'll likely find me
idling in #redeclipse on Freenode (among other places).

Disclaimer
----------
It should be noted that (at least currently) this syntax file is generally
tailored to the Cube2 Engine, more specifically the [Red Eclipse][3] fork.
While there should be many similarities and likely few differences, at this
stage in development it is safe to assume this syntax offers limited support
outside of Red Eclipse. However, broader support for Cube and its derivations is
planned (and of course contributions are welcome!).
